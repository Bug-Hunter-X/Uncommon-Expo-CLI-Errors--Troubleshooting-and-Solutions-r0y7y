This error typically arises when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's SDK version, or when the project's dependencies have conflicting versions.  It could also be caused by problems with your project's configuration files like `app.json` or `package.json` .  The error message itself is often not very specific, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact problem without further investigation.
