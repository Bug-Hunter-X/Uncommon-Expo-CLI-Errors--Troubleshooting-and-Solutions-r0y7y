The solution often involves carefully checking the `package.json` and `app.json` files for inconsistencies. Verify that the Expo CLI version is compatible with the project's SDK version.  Use the Expo CLI's debugging tools like `expo start --verbose` for more detailed logs.  If dependency conflicts are suspected, use tools like `npm-check` or `yarn why` to analyze and resolve them.   Sometimes, completely cleaning the project's cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) or deleting the `.expo` directory followed by reinstalling dependencies can resolve these issues.  In some cases, creating a new Expo project with a fresh setup and gradually transferring your code can help isolate problem areas.
